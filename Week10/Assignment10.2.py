# Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of
# the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a
#  second time using a colon.

# Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below. Note that
# the autograder does not have support for the sorted() function.
# Desired output:
# 04 3
# 06 1
# 07 1
# 09 2
# 10 3
# 11 6
# 14 1
# 15 2
# 16 4
# 17 2
# 18 1
# 19 1
